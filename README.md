# Problem:
According to the UN, the Syrian refugee crisis is the worst humanitarian crisis since World War

II, with over 10 million people displaced, 60% of whom are women and children. Prenatal care and childhood immunizations are essential services that prevent significant morbidity and mortality. Evidence indicates that timely and complete uptake of these health services is low among Syrian refugees in Turkey, our focus country, and comparable places:

* Less than 50% of pregnant Syrians attend at least four prenatal care visits and only 13-25% of children are fully-immunized. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases among refugee children are increasing despite numerous immunization campaigns.

* In Turkey, as few as 59% of Syrian refugee children outside of camps are immunized for measles. Even though the Turkish government provides free healthcare to Syrian refugees, studies and our first-hand experiences indicate that women face many barriers to accessing services for themselves and their children, including:

** Language barriers, which complicate navigating an unfamiliar, complex health system;

** Competing demands such as managing their family’s numerous other settlement needs;

** Fear of deportation or other consequences if they access health services; and

** Lost or non-existent medical records, which hinder continuity of care.

# Objectives
Increase uptake of timely vaccination in refugee communities.
Increase uptake of prenatal care in refugee women.
Prevent amenable mortality and morbidity due to migration and related social determinants of health.

# How do we do it? 

HERA works as a bridge between Syrian refugee women and children and the Turkish health

system. As an app-based mobile health platform, HERA provides:

* Push notification reminders: Users receive three notifications (a week prior, a day prior, and the day of their appointment).

* Electronic health record keeping: Users can scan and store medical information and notes in a cloud-based server, protected by EU-compliant security measures.

* Health facility location finder: Users can locate, view details for nearby health centers.

* Emergency service call: With a single tap, users can call emergency services and the app announces the location of the caller in Turkish for the emergency service responder.

* Education: Users can access health education and information about the health system.


Once a user downloads and opens the HERA app (available in Arabic, Turkish and English) they are prompted to enter their health information. The app then automatically calculates the dates for their four prenatal care visits and remaining immunizations for their children using Turkish vaccination calendar.

# As of December 2019

HERA's proof of concept phase is finishing in January 2020. Transition to scale is planned as two pronged operation. International and national scale up. Progress to date in international scale up is registering as a non-profit in US and moving business development activities overseas. International scale up is to be continued via HERA Inc. in Boston / MA. While national scale up eventually leads to complete integration to MoH's health activities towards refugees, to date, we started the protocol to incorporate HERA in local MoH owned primary healthcare centers. Long term strategy plan is presented in impact strategy part. Specific needs are described as below:

1- IT support: In order for HERA to be more adaptable to specific needs of different refugee populations, we require IT partners.

2- Animation Video: One feedback we received from our current users was that they were not sure about how to use the app in a useful way. We indluded addition of an explainer animation video for our scale up plans.

3- International partners for joint grant applications: Since mhealth is relatively new sector in medicine, there is hype and following financial support from different grantors. However we require other organizations to apply together and implement HERA in different settings.

4- Adaptation of HERA to an 'open sourced - open science' basis: With the start of our involvement in JOGL Program, we devoted some of our efforts to making HERA more open and available to other people to use, further develop and comment. We require an advisory group on this issue to increase HERA's openness as a project.


# How to contribute

HERA Project is an open-source web platform, currently offered through a mobile application. People can contribute to our codes since it is publicly available. In addition, anyone can use our codes as a base to their interventions for other populations. In addition, interested parties can contribute to HERA in parallel to our 'needs' described in JOGL. Namely, business development, integration and field tests in other populations, P&R material creation and support, UX / UI design. We are also happy to collaborate with organizations and partners for global health / mobile health grant applications. For collaborations, they can contact Aral Sürmeli through JOGL, or given contact info and discuss how we can work together. The main condition we put forward is that any work related to HERA will be non-profit, meaning the primary aim of any activity will be to improve health of vulnerable populations. We are a group of passionate professionals focused on this aim and always looking for people to share information, guidance and collaboration without any reservation. We are always working on making our work more open for reproductivity and collaboration.
